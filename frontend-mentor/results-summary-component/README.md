### The challenge

This is a simple project that uses only HTML and CSS. I decided to use a tool that I've never worked with and it was really pleasant to do.

## My process

My girlfriend is learning UI design. So, she replicated the [design](https://www.figma.com/file/exDA22GN3b0ChGJYOrCFE5/Results-Summary?node-id=0%3A1&t=F47wigKBXDRnfSy7-1) on figma and I brought it alive using Tailwind CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is the first project I work with Tailwind CSS. In my opinion it's a bit verbose and takes some getting used to the syntax. However, once you get the idea and flow related to class names, it seems to get easier and speedier development.
