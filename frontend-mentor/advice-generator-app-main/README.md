## My process

My girlfriend is learning UI design. So, she replicated the [design](https://www.figma.com/file/nXASqFz3L1YWrPSPwiGUYY/Advice-Generator-app?node-id=1%3A30&t=8V23m23dJpoRensd-1) on figma and I brought it alive using Tailwind CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript 

### What I learned

The second small project working with Tailwind CSS, now I see how it is powerful and how you get used to the syntax. It just come on your mind and you just need to make it happen.
