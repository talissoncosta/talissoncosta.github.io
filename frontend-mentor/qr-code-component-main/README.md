## My process

My girlfriend is learning UI design. So, she replicated the [design](https://www.figma.com/file/fL480Stwlq9Wd2a96D0Jef/Qr-Code-Component?node-id=1%3A2&t=NODngVLjsAB7FXzq-1) on figma and I brought it alive using Tailwind CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The second small project working with Tailwind CSS, now I see how it is powerful and how you get used to the sintax. It just come on your mind and you just need to make it happen.
